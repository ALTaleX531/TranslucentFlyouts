> When TranslucentFlyouts V2 is complete, I will sync the code to Github.
> This is expected to be completed in July, when new features and functionality, as well as improvements, will be available. 

> One more thing I need to say that TranslucentFlyouts V1 may cause explorer to crash while using with [ExplorerBlurMica](https://github.com/Maplespe/ExplorerBlurMica)
