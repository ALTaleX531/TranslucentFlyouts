# TranslucentFlyouts V2
An application that makes most of the win32 popup menus translucent/transparent on Windows 10/11, providing more options to tweak it to meet your need.

Compared to V1, TranslucentFlyouts V2 has better compatibility and the ability to customize.   
TranslucentFlyouts V1 has been moved to [TranslucentFlyoutsV1](https://github.com/ALTaleX531/TranslucentFlyoutsV1).   
**TranslucentFlyouts uses [LGNU V3 license](./COPYING.LESSER) started from V2.**

### Uninstall

2. Logoff to take effect.

## Limitations and Compatibility
### Here are some situations that TranslucentFlyouts will always be automatically disabled.
### 1. Windows 2000 Style popup menu  
![Windows2000](./Images/Unsupported/Windows2000.png)

Outdated.   
Some third-party applications like `HoneyView` may cause this issue.
### 2. Ownerdrawn popup menu
![Ownerdrawn](./Images/Unsupported/Ownerdrawn.png)

As you can see, it is a QT popup menu.  
It really looks like the default menu, isn't it?  
But it's rendering procedure is completely different from the defualt one, making TranslucentFlyout hard to modify its visual content.  
### **3. StartAllBack**
`StartAllBack` has built-in support for translucent popup menu, and its rendering procedure priority is higher than TranslucentFlyouts.  
> [Note!]:  
> For this reason, `v2.0.0-alpha.4` and higher versions of TranslucentFlyouts will automatically disable itself when `StartAllBack` was detected, unless there is a way to fully disable `StartAllBack`' s handling procedure.  
> However, TranslucentFlyouts is still available for other applications except `Explorer`.

**It may possibly also cause this issue when StartAllBack is installed**  
![StartAllBack_MenuItemWithFlaws](./Images/StartAllBack/MenuItemWithFlaws.png)
![StartAllBack_MenuItemColoredWithFlaws](./Images/StartAllBack/MenuItemColoredWithFlaws.png)   
As you can see there is a white border around the menu item, it will always exist until you disable or uninstall StartAllBack...  
For now, there are two ways to solve this.   
1. Set the dword value `EnableCustomRendering` to non-zero for TranslucentFlyouts.   
Registry path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\TranslucentFlyouts\Menu\EnableCustomRendering
2. Install a custom theme.
